## Origin
I was originally born in a beautiful coastal city in southern China and moved to Houston when I attended high school. 

At present, I am going to obtain both B.S. in `Computer Science` & B.S. in `Statistics` at [Texas A & M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) in May 2022. Gig 'em! 

## Interest
My research interest is applying `information analytics` and `machine learning` to solving progressive social issues or interesting public topics. I would like to work on complex and richly-labeled relational data in any format, from graphs to networks, images, or videos at all scales.


## Experience
I posted a series of my [projects](/projects/), [research work](/research/), and [teaching experience](/teaching/) on the site.

## Art
I love music and `art` because both can spread a message of inspiration, helping people achieve the betterment of thoughts and life. I have put up some of my best art pieces in the [gallery](/gallery/) and please check it out!
